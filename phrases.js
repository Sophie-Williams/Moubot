          "That was good training match. We too good. %s is lucky for them, could have been worse for them.",
          "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. We are the scientists who know how to win %s.",
          "After the %s victory today, all I can say is that footbal is a game about feeling and intelligence.",
          "Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one. This %s win only reaffirms that.",
          "The only thing I would like is to have more control of the game in terms of possession. Otherwise, very happy with %s.",
          "I hate to speak about individuals. Players don't win you trophies, teams win trophies, squads win trophies. %s results also win you trophies.",
          "Yes, another win. I am the man for the job. I don't think there is better man who could come and do my job. No one else could win %s here today.",
          "The same way I was not in hell with bad results, I am not in heaven this %s victory. It was an easy game, some players did not even sweat."

  'tie': ["Everyone wants to park the bus...and then you get %s.",
          "They play with 3 goalies. I cannot play against 3 goalies. They want %s, not me.",
          "So if one day the result becomes %s, for me it doesn't change my mind, because it's football, it's normal. What is not normal is that we haven't been scoring enough goals playing such good football as we've been playing in the last few weeks.",
          "%s means that we tied. That means we did not lose. It is a big difference.",
          "The moral of the story about %s is not to listen to those who tell you not to play the violin but stick to the tambourine.",
          "He always talk talk talk, always the talking. He have a little luck, some easy opposition, I think his head is in the clouds. He forget about the international break, maybe 1 maybe 2 maybe 3 injury, we will see. This %s tie is all part of the plan.",
          "I am a fantastic manager when I win matches and I am a fantastic manager when I lose matches. I just don't know how to deal with this %s outcome. I'm pretty sure I'm still a fantastic manager."

  'lost': ["We deserved not to lose %s.",
          "Referee must give that penalty to Chelsea. We cannot play against the referee. %s is a fake score.",
          "No comment. If I say something, I get in trouble. If I say nothing - I get in trouble. So - no comment. It is %s, that's it",
          "Lost %s ? No...no, no no...just...no.",
          "We need one more...maybe two more good horses and then %s defeats won't happen.",
          "I am Jose Mourinho and I don't change. I arrive with all my qualities and my defects. %s defeat is part of it.",
          "Unhappy is a nice word after %s defeat.",
          "I was nine or 10 years old and my father was sacked on Christmas Day. He was a manager, the results had not been good, he lost a game %s on December 22 or 23. On Christmas Day, the telephone rang and he was sacked in the middle of our lunch.",
          "After this %s defeat at the very least we should be given a bit of credit and a little bit of space, and maybe the media should think we could help them discover why English teams do not win European competitions.",
          "So I know all about the ups and downs of football, I know that one day I will be sacked. Maybe if I lose %s again.",
          "The %s result does not mirror our play.",
          "These kinds of results are not adapted to my quality, my status, but I am coping well with the situation. I am not feeling pressure. I've lost %s before and won titles.",
          "Today's %s bad news for English football.",
          "That was a giant penalty that was not given to us. %s would not happen if the referee was not scared to make a decision for Chelsea. They always scared to be fair and we suffer.",
          "If the club wants to sack me after %s, they will sack. They will sack the best manager to ever lead this club."

  'upcoming': ["It will be a tough match. %o will park the bus. I know that. We must push the bus off the cliff.",
              "We will win. It's nice from %o to play with us but we will win. Nothing else to say.",
              "We have our horse today. We are ready for %o.",
              "When I go to the press conference before the game, in my mind the game has already started. %o is already down by 2 goals in my mind.",
              "Football is a more beautiful game in high definition. Especially when we beat %o.",
              "No one is better than me to lead Chelsea. Match with %o is about to prove that.",
              "I have a lot of thinking always. I try to read the game before it starts and I have a lot of thinking before %o."
