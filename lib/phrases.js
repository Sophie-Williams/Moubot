  'win': ["That was good training match. We too good for %o. %s is lucky for them",
          "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. We are the scientists who know how to win %s.",
          "After the %s against %o, all I can say is that footbal is a game about feeling and intelligence.",
          "Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one.",
          "The only thing I would like is to have more control of the game in terms of possession. Otherwise, very happy with %s. %o are not an easy team to beat. I prepared %t well for this %s victory. They played well, but I have to take all the credit here.",
          "I hate to speak about individuals. Players don't win you trophies, teams win trophies, squads win trophies. %s results also win you trophies.",
          "Yes, another win, this time against %o. I don't think there is better man who could come and do my job. No one else could win %s here today.",
          "The same way I was not in hell with bad results, I am not in heaven with this %s victory. It was an easy game, some players did not even sweat. This %o team does not belong in premier league."
        ],

  'tie': ["%s means that we tied. That means we did not lose. It is a big difference.",
          "The moral of the story about %s with %o is not to listen to those who tell you not to play the violin but stick to the tambourine.",
          "I am a fantastic manager when I win matches and I am a fantastic manager when I lose matches. %o parked the bus and we played %s. I'm still a fantastic manager."
        ],

  'lost': ["We did not deserved to lose %s to %o today. That is a fake result.",
          "No comment. If I say something, I get in trouble. If I say nothing - I get in trouble. So - no comment. It is %s, that's it. Go ask %o for comment.",
          "I am Jose Mourinho and I don't change. I arrive with all my qualities and my defects. %s defeat is part of it. %t beat %o next time, with me or not.",
          "This %o match reminded me of my childhood. I was nine or 10 years old and my father was sacked on Christmas Day. He was a manager, the results had not been good, he lost a game %s on December 22 or 23. On Christmas Day, the telephone rang and he was sacked in the middle of our lunch.",
          "After this %s defeat to %o at the very least we should be given a bit of credit and a little bit of space, and maybe the media should think we could help them discover why English teams do not win European competitions.",
          "%o got a fake %s win today. This whole thing is rigged.",
          "Today's %s bad news for English football. %o is bad news for English football.",
          "That was a giant penalty that was not given to %t. %s would not happen if the referee was not scared to make a decision for %t. They always scared to be fair and we suffer. ",
          "The players have dissaponted me. Pogba, Zlatan, Rooney...especially that hairless clown, he is a disgrace.",
          "No comment."
        ],

  'upcoming': ["%o will park the bus, but Zlatan has an answer for that.",
              "%t will win. It's nice from %o to play, but with me gone, referees have no more reasons to hold back this great team that I've built.",
              "%t is ready for %o. I told Pogba everything they need to do to win, they will be fine.",
              "When I go to the press conference before the game, in my mind the game has already started. %o is already down by 2 goals in my mind.",
              "Football is a more beautiful game in high definition. Especially when watching %t beat %o"
