  'win': ["Easy %s victory. %o is a funny team. %s against %o is nothing to be proud of. I win these games even when I'm not leading %t from the bench.",
          "That was good training match. We too good for %o. %s is lucky for them, could have been worse for them if I was on the bench.",
          "Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains. Sometimes you have ugly people who are intelligent, like scientists. We are the scientists who know how to win %s. If I was still on the bench, we would be beautiful scientists.",
          "After the %s against %o, all I can say is that footbal is a game about feeling and intelligence. I left behind smart players who play exactly as I ask them.",
          "Please don't call me arrogant, but I'm European champion and I think I'm a special one. This %s win over %o only reaffirms that, even though I wasn't even there.",
          "The only thing I would like is to have more control of the game in terms of possession. Otherwise, very happy with %s. %o are not an easy team to beat. I prepared %t well for this %s victory.",
          "I hate to speak about individuals. Players don't win you trophies, teams win trophies, squads win trophies. %s results also win you trophies. Good managers win you trophies, so too bad for %t to fire the best manager in the history of the club.",
          "Yes, another win, this time against %o. I am the man for the job, I made this victory happen before I left. I don't think there is better man who could come and do my job. No one else could win %s here today.",
          "The same way I was not in hell with bad results, I am not in heaven with this %s victory. It was an easy game, some players did not even sweat. This %o team does not belong in premier league.",
          "I saw that %s win over %o from the pub today. My ID card did not work at the gate today, I miss the team bus. %t did well, finally played just like I ask them to play."
        ],

  'tie': ["Everyone wants to park the bus...and then you get %s. %o defend with 9 men. How can we do better than %s when they park the bus?",
          "They play with 3 goalies. I cannot play against 3 goalies. %o want %s, not me, I want attractive footbal today but they don't let me. They don't even let me in the stadium today. I watch on telly.",
          "So if one day the result becomes %s, for me it doesn't change my mind, because it's football, it's normal. What is not normal is that %t haven't been scoring enough goals playing such good football as we've been playing in the last few weeks.",
          "%s means that we tied. That means we did not lose. It is a big difference. I left the team in the state where they no lose any more.",
          "The moral of the story about %s with %o is not to listen to those who tell you not to play the violin but stick to the tambourine. %t sacked the best manager in the history, now they no longer have the tambourine either.",
          "%o always talk talk talk, always the talking. He have a little luck, some easy opposition, I think his head is in the clouds. He forget about the international break, maybe 1 maybe 2 maybe 3 injury, we will see. This %s tie is all part of the plan. I come back in May and win a trophy.",
          "I am a fantastic manager when I win matches and I am a fantastic manager when I lose matches. %o parked the bus and we played %s. I'm still a fantastic manager. Even when I'm not on the bench."
        ],

  'lost': ["We deserved to lose %s to %o today. That is not a fake result. I would have won this match.",
          "You still blame Jose? %o won %s but Jose was not there. Who's fault is it now?.",
          "No comment. If I say something, I get in trouble. If I say nothing - I get in trouble. So - no comment. It is %s, that's it. Go ask %o for comment.",
          "Lost %s ? I didn't know, I don't watch football today. I look for job today. Maybe %o interested, I should check.",
          "I brought Diego to %t so that %s defeats won't happen. %o got us on a bad day, when I wasn't in.",
          "I am Jose Mourinho and I don't change. I arrive with all my qualities and my defects. %s defeat is part of it. %t beat %o next time, with me or not.",
          "This %o match reminded me of my childhood. I was nine or 10 years old and my father was sacked on Christmas Day. He was a manager, the results had not been good, he lost a game %s on December 22 or 23. On Christmas Day, the telephone rang and he was sacked in the middle of our lunch.",
          "After this %s defeat to %o at the very least we should be given a bit of credit and a little bit of space, and maybe the media should think we could help them discover why English teams do not win European competitions. Maybe sacking a manager at Christmas time is not a good idea.",
          "So I know all about the ups and downs of football, I knew that one day I would be sacked. If I wasn't, maybe if I would not have lost %s today.",
          "%o got a fake %s win today. I built a better team.",
          "Today's %s bad news for English football. %o is bad news for English football.",
          "That was a giant penalty that was not given to %t. %s would not happen if the referee was not scared to make a decision for %t. They always scared to be fair and we suffer. That's why i got sacked.",
          "They club sacked the best manager to ever lead this club. And then everyone surprised when %t loses %s to %o? I'm not surprised.",
          "The players have dissaponted me. Even though I wasn't on the bench today, %s defeat to %o is a betrayal.",
          "I see %o result from today, %s is a tragedy. I call the boss back to see if I can have the job back."

  'upcoming': ["I prepared the team well before I left. %o will park the bus, but Willian has an answer for that.",
              "%t will win. It's nice from %o to play, but with me gone, referees have no more reasons to hold back this great team that I've built.",
              "%t is ready for %o. I told Hazard everything they need to do to win, they will be fine.",
              "When I go to the press conference before the game, in my mind the game has already started. %o is already down by 2 goals in my mind.",
              "Football is a more beautiful game in high definition. Especially when watching %t beat %o from the comfort of my own couch.",
              "No one is better than me to lead %t. Match with %o is about to prove that. I know exactly how I would have won this match"
